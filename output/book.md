#Spec: a new framework for describing user interfaces


##1\. Introduction


Writing user interfaces is notoriously a tedious task\.It often requires time and a clear understanding of the separation of concerns\. Indeed most of the frameworks mix domain applicative models with widget models\.

*Spec* is a framework for describing user interfaces\. It allows the separation of concerns between the different part of the user interface as expressed in the MVP pattern\.*Spec* emphasis the reuse of the widgets as well as there customization\.

This article goal is to provide an overview of the *Spec* functionalities\. The general purpose of *Spec* will be explained through several examples among sections\.

First the 3 pillars of *Spec* will be explained\. Second we expose how *Spec* reuse subwidgets and how to customize widgets to make them fit the user needs\.Third the API of the *Spec* basic models is detailled as well as how to understand the meta information attached to this API\. The fourth section covers the two dynamic aspects of *Spec*\. The final section is dedicated to the creation of your own *Spec* model\.

##2\.  The heart of Spec
<a name="sec_heart_of_spec"></a>

Spec is built around three axes that are inspired by the MVP pattern\.These axes materialize themselves as the following three methods: `initializeWidgets`, `initializePresenter`, and `defaultSpec`\.


    Note: For JF we need to talk about the name of the class, you need to subclass it to make a new UI




    Note: For JF add some blah of the interplay/how the 3 work together to build the overall UI and we discuss the role of the 3 methods here


We first detail some necessary terminology before discussing each of these methods in more detail\.


To avoid possible misunderstandings in this text due to confusion in terminology, we define four terms:
<dl><dt>UI Element
</dt><dd>an interactive graphical element displayed as part of the Graphical User Interface.</dd><dt>UI Model
</dt><dd>an object that contains the state and behavior of one or several UI elements.</dd><dt>Widget
</dt><dd>the union of a UI Element and its UI model.</dd><dt>Basic widgets
</dt><dd>low level widgets like a list, a button, etc. They are not composed of other widgets.</dd></dl>



###2\.1\.  the *initializeWidgets* method  <sub>\(the MVP View\)</sub>


This method is used to instantiate the different widgets that are part of the UI and store them in their respective instance variables\.The configuration and default values of each widget are specified here as well\.This focus in this method is to specify what the widgets will look like and what their self\-contained behavior is\.It is explicitly **not** the responsibility of this method to define the interactions **between** the widgets\.



    Note: For Ben: what happens with saving to the model ??



In general the `initializeWidgets` method should follow the pattern:


-  widgets instantiation
-  widgets configuration specification
-  specification of order of focus

&nbsp;



    Note: For Ben: is the last step mandatory? What happens if there is no focus order? No tab focus or random?



The code in figure [2\.1](#fig:pattern) shows an example of an `initializeWidgets` method\.It first instantiates a button and a list widget, storing each in an instance variable\.It second configures the button it by setting its label\.Third it specifies the focus order of all the widgets: first the button and then the list\.



    Note: For Ben: is the code of this example correct and consistent with the explanation? (I changed it)





<a name="fig:pattern"></a>**Example of initializeWidgets**


    initializeWidgets
    
    	theButton := self newButton.
    	theList := self newList.
    
    	theButton label: 'I am a button'.
    	
    	self focusOrder
    		add: theButton;
    		add:theList.






    Specifying this method is mandatory, as without it the UI would have no widgets.




####2\.1\.1\.  Widget instantiation


The instantiation of a widget can be done in two ways: through the use of an creation method or through the use of the `instantiate:` method\.Considering the first option, the framework provides unary messages for the creation of all basic widgets\.The format of these messages is `new[Widget]`, for example `newButton` creates a button widget, and `newList` creates a list widget, as we have seen above\.The complete list of available widget creation methods can be found in the class *ComposableModel* in the protocol *widgets*\.Considering the second option, to reuse any composite widgets, i\.e\. a subclass of *ComposableModel*, the widget needs to be initialized using the `instantiate:` method\.For example, to reuse a *MessageBrowser*  widget, the code is ` self instantiate: MessageBrowser.`


###2\.2\.  The *initializePresenter* method <sub>\(the MVP Interactor\)</sub>


This method takes care of the interactions between the different widgets\.By linking the behavior of the different widgets it specifies the overall presentation, i\.e\. how the overall UI responds to interactions by the user\.

Usually this method consists of specifications of actions to perform when a certain event is received by a widget\.From the propagation of those events the whole interaction flow of the UI emerges\.In  **Spec**, the different widgets are contained in value holders, and the event mechanism relies on the announcements of these value holders to manage the interactions between widgets\.Value holders provide a single method `whenChangedDo:` that is used to register a block to perform on change\.In addition to this primitive  `whenChangedDo:` method, the basic widgets provide more specific hooks, e\.g\. when an item in a list is selected or deselected\.



    Note: For Ben: please add an example that makes the button active when a list item is selected and inactive when a list item is deselected



The whole event API of the basic widgets is described in the section [Â¿?](#sec_where_to_find_what_I_want)\.




    If a programmer wants his or her widgets to be reused,
    they should provide a comprehensive API.






    This method is optional. Without it, the different widgets in the UI will simply not respond to changes in each others' state.




###2\.3\.  the *defaultSpec* method <sub>\(the MVP Presenter\)</sub>


This method specifies the layout of the different widgets in the UI\.It also specifies how a widget reacts when the window is resized\.

For the same UI multiple layouts can be described, and when the UI is built a specific layout can be specified\.If no specific layout is given, the layout returned by the `defaultSpec` method will be used\.This method is on class side because it returns a value that usually is the same for all the instances\.Put differently, usually all the instances of the same user interface have the same layout and hence this can be considered as being a class\-side accessor for a class variable\.Note that the lookup for the spec method to use starts on instance side, which allows a UI to have a more specific layout depending on the state of the instance\.

The simpliest example of such a method is laying out just one widget\.The example [2\.2](#fig:ex_layout1) presents such a layout\.It returns a layout in which just one widget is added: the widget contained in `theList` instance variable\.



<a name="fig:ex_layout1"></a>**Layout with only one widget**


    ^ SpecLayout composed
    	add: #theList;
    	yourself



The symbol `theList` refers to an instance side method returning a widget\.This is because as instance variables are private, the layout class needs to use an accessor to obtain it when building the UI\.Note that by default, a widget will take all the space available\.

As said above, multiple views can be described for the same user interface\.In order to retrieve the correct method to apply, these methods need to be flagged with a pragma\.The pragma can be either `<spec: default>` for the view to use by default, or `<spec>` for the other views\.



    Note: For Ben. You need to clarify the name defaultSpec versus the pragmas and give an enumerated list that describes the method lookup for this guy







    Specifying this method is mandatory, as without it the UI would show no widgets to the user.





####2\.3\.1\.  Layout Examples




    Note: For Ben. I am not sure that this is the right place for this, but I don't know a better place for now.



As layouts can become quite complex, this section provides a list of examples of the construction of layouts\.First two examples are given of the use of [rows and columns](#layout_rows_and_column_layout)\.This is followed by two examples that explain how to set a [fixed size](#layout_set_size_pixels) for rows and columns\.Next is an example that explains how to specify a widget [proportionally](#layout_percentage)\.The last example presents the [expert](#layout_expert) mode in case everything else fails\.To conclude, this section ends with a little [explanation](#layout_specify_layout) of how to specify which view to use and where to find the complete API\.
<a name="layout_rows_and_column_layout"></a>
Often the layout of user interfaces can be described in rows and columns, and **Spec** provides for an easy way to specify such layouts\.The example [2\.3](#fig:ex_layout_row) shows how to build a row of widgets\.



<a name="fig:ex_layout_row"></a>**Row of widgets**


    ^ SpecLayout composed
    	newRow: [ :row |
    		row
    			add: #theList;
    			add: #theButton
    	];
    	yourself



Having the widgets rendered as a column is similar, as shown in the example [2\.4](#fig:ex_layout_column)



<a name="fig:ex_layout_column"></a>**Column of widgets**


    ^ SpecLayout composed
    	newColumn: [ :column |
    		column
    			add: #theList;
    			add: #theButton
    	];
    	yourself





    Note: For Ben: I think this needs an example that nests rows in columns or vice-versa.




---

<a name="layout_set_size_pixels"></a>
The height of rows as well as the width of columns can be specified, to prevent them to take all the available space\.The example [2\.5](#fig:ex_row_height) shows how to specify the height of a row in pixels while the example [2\.6](#fig:ex_column_width) how to specify the column width\.



<a name="fig:ex_row_height"></a>**Row of 30 pixels**


    ^ SpecLayout composed
    	newRow: [ :row |
    		row
    			add: #theList;
    			add: #theButton
    	] height: 30;
    	yourself





<a name="fig:ex_column_width"></a>**Column of 30 pixels**


    ^ SpecLayout composed
    	newColumn: [ :column |
    		column
    			add: #theList;
    			add: #theButton
    	] width: 30;
    	yourself



Note that it is generally considered a bad habit to hardcode the size of the widgets\.Methods are available on *ComposableModel* providing sensible default sizes, like the width of a button\.When specifying custom widget sizes, care should be taken to take in account the current font size\.


---

<a name="layout_percentage"></a>
It is also possible to specify the percentage of the container, e\.g\. the window, that a widget should occupy\.As a result of this, the widget size will change accordingly when the container is resized\.To do so, the proportional position of the four sides of a widget can be specified, as shown in the example [2\.7](#ex_layout_proportional)\.



<a name="ex_layout_proportional"></a>**A Button centered in, and half the size of its container**


    ^ SpecLayout composed
    	add: #theButton top: 0.25 bottom: 0.25 left: 0.25 right: 0.25;
    	yourself



Note that the value provided as argument moves the corresponding side toward the center of the widget\.Also, the argument can be an integer if the offset has to be a fixed number of pixels\.



    Note: For Ben: negative offsets are possible and have semantics like in morphic? If so, explain (not saying, like in Morphic )



---

<a name="layout_expert"></a>
The previous examples should cover most of the cases of layout of widgets\.For the remaining cases there is a last way to specify a widget by specifying its position\.

The method `add: origin: corner: ` of `SpecLayout` specifies the layout of a widget, percentage\-wise from the origin point to the corner point\.These two points represent respectively the top left corner and the bottom right corner of the widget\.The arguments express a percentage of the container, so these <u>must</u> be between *0@0* and *1@1* \.

In addition to those points, two offsets can be also be specified, using the method\. `add: origin: corner:  offsetOrigin: offsetCorner: `\.The offsets specify the number of pixels that the origin and the corner should be moved\.



    Note: For Ben: negative integer offsets are allowed? If so, say: negative offsets are allowed, similar to the offset example above.



Note that this approach is similar to the ProportionalLayout of **Morphic**\.


The example [2\.8](#fig:ex_layout_expert) shows how to add a widget as a toolbar\.It specifies that the widget in the `toolbar` instance variable should take all the window width, but should be only 30 pixels in height\.



<a name="fig:ex_layout_expert"></a>**Using expert mode to specify a toolbar**


    ^ SpecLayout composed
    	add: #toolbar origin: 0@0 corner: 1@0 offsetOrigin: 0@0 offsetCorner: 0@30;
    	yourself




---

<a name="layout_specify_layout"></a>

As explained in the section [Â¿?](#subsec_pragma), a UI can have multiple views\.So when a widget layout is specified, the view to use for this sub widget can be specified\.

All the methods seen in the previous examples come with a variant used to specify which view selector to use\.By example, for the `add:` methods there is also  `add:withSpec:`\.All the methods can be found in the *commands* and *commands\-advanced* protocols of **SpecLayout**\.



    Note: For Ben. I don't understand the text above. (And I think I have seen it before.) Please expand with an example.



##3\.  Where to find what I want


##4\.  Spec the Dynamic
<a name="sec_spec_the_dynamic"></a>

Having an user interface with a well known number of sub widgets and a static layout should now sounds easy\. But an user interface is often more than just that\. There are two situations where you need more\. First it happens that the layout of the user interface need to be changed at runtime to match the execution context\.Second if sub widgets are added or removed at runtime\. Then the programmer need to be able to parametrize those new sub widgets on the fly\.


###4\.1\.  Dynamic modification of the layout


Changing a widget layout at runtime is quite easy\.It consists of three steps: creating the new layout, setting the needed flag, and build the widget again with the newly created layout\.

The snippet [4\.1](#rebuildDynamically) shows how to simply rebuild a widget with a new layout\.



<a name="rebuildDynamically"></a>**Rebuild a widget at run time**


    rebuildWithNewLayout
    	| newLayout |
    
    	newLayout := self newLayoutCreatedDynamically.
    	self needRebuild: false. "tells the interpreter to keep my current ui element"
    	self buildWithSpecLayout: newLayout. "rebuilds me with the new layout"



One widget can also keep the ui elements of its sub widgets which did not need to be rebuilt\.The message `needRebuild: false` need to be sent to any of those sub widgets\.


###4\.2\.  Dynamic add and removal of subwidgets


If an user interface needs a various number of sub widgets that can not be predicted at compilation time, another approach is needed\.When one faces this scenario, he or she should subclass `DynamicComposableModel` for his or her application\.

Then the instantion of the sub widgets is a bit different\.The method `instantiateModels:` should be used\.It takes as argument an array of pairs\.Each pair is composed of the unique name of the widget as key, and the name of the widget class as value\.Then a widget can be accessed by sending a message whose selector is the widget name\.

By example, if a widget named `button` is created, the this widget can be accessed by calling `self button` as shown in the example [4\.2](#ex_dynamic_creation)\.



<a name="ex_dynamic_creation"></a>**Dynamic creation of a widget**


    self instantiateModels: { 'button' -> 'ButtonModel' }.
    	self button label: 'Click me'.




Note that the instantiation array can also be an array of pairs\. The previous example could be written



<a name="ex_dynamic_creation2"></a>**Dynamic creation of a widget**


    self instantiateModels: #( button ButtonModel ).
    	self button label: 'Click me'.




####4\.2\.1\.  Example


Thanks to the *Spec* capability to dynamically instantiate widgets, it is also possible to prototype an user interface\.From within any workspace a new user interface can be easily defined\.

The example [4\.4](#ex_prototyping) shows how to easily and quickly design a popup window asking for an input\.



<a name="ex_prototyping"></a>**Popup requiring a simple input**


    view := DynamicComposableModel new
    	instantiateModels: #(label LabelModel text TextInputFieldModel);
    	extent: 300@90;
    	title: 'Choose your project'
    	yourself.
    	
    toolbar := OkToolbar new
    	okAction: [ regex := view text text ];
    	yourself.
    	view focusOrder add: view text.
    view text bindKeyCombination: Character cr asKeyCombination  toAction: [ toolbar triggerOkAction ].
    view label text: 'Packages:'.
    view text
    	autoAccept: true;
    		entryCompletion: nil;
    	ghostText: '.*'.
    view openDialogWithSpecLayout: (SpecLayout composed
    		newRow: [ :r | r add: #label width: 75; add: #text ];
    yourself))
    	toolbar: toolbar;
    	centered;
    	modalRelativeTo: World.



The result can be seen in Figure [4\.1](#fig_popup)\.

##5\.  Creating new basic widget


*Spec* provides for a large amount and wide variety of basic widgets\. In the rare case that a basic widget is missing, the *Spec* framework will need to be extended to add this new widget\.In this section we will explain how to create such a new basic widget\.

We will first explain the applicable part of how the widget build process is performed\.This will reveal the different actors in the process and provide a clearer understanding of their responsibilities\.We then present the three steps of widget creation: writing a new model, writing an adapter, and updating or creating an individual UI framework binding\.


###5\.1\.  One step in the building process of a widget


The UI building process does not make a distinction between basic and composed widgets\.Hence, at a specific point in the building process of a basic widget the default spec method of the widget is called, just as if it would be a composed widget\.However in this case, instead of providing a layout for multiple widgets that comprise the UI, this method builds an adapter to the underlying UI framework\.Depending of the underlying UI framework that is currently used, this method can provide different kind of adapters, for example an adapter for Morphic, or an adapter for Seaside, etc\.

The adapter, when created, will instantiate a widget that is specific to the UI framework being used\.


    Note: For Ben: please clarify the 'when created'. Is this when the spec method executes, or at some later point in time?


For example, when using a List in the Morphic UI, the adaptor will be a MorphicListAdapter and it will contain a PluggableListMorph\.This is this framework specific widget which will be returned by the model and rendered\.


    Note: For Ben: It is not clear when it will be returned, and to who it will be returned, and how this links to it being rendered.



Figure [5\.1](#model_adapter_uielement) shows the relationship between those objects\.


    Note: For Ben: Model is an instance of Adapter and Adapter is an instance of UI Element? That can not be right ...



<a name="model\_adapter\_uielement"></a>![model\_adapter\_uielement](figures/Model-Adapter-UIElement.png "Relationship between the model, the adapter, and the ui element")


###5\.2\.  The Model


The new model needs to be a subclass of **AbstractWidgetModel** and its name should be composed of the new basic widget concept, e\.g\. list or button, and of the word *Model*\.The responsibility of the model is to store all the state of the widget\.Examples of widget\-specific state are:

-  the index of a list
-  the label of a button
-  the action block for when a text is validated in a text field

&nbsp;

The state is wrapped in value holders and kept in instance variables\.For example, the code in [5\.1](#ex_value_holder) shows how to wrap the state `0` in a value holder and keep it as an instance variable\.Value holders are needed because they are later used to propagate state changes and thus create the interaction flow of the user interface, as discussed in Section [2](#sec_heart_of_spec)\.



<a name="ex_value_holder"></a>**Storing state wrapped in a Value Holder in an instance variable**


    index := 0 asValueHolder.



For each instance variable that holds state three methods should be defined: the getter, the setter, and the registration method\.The first two should classified in the protocol named *protocol* while the registration method should be in *protocol\-events*\.For example, the code in [5\.2](#ex_mutators) shows the methods for the example code in [5\.1](#ex_value_holder)\. 



<a name="ex_mutators"></a>**Example of mutators for index**


    "in protocol: protocol"
    index
    	^index value
    
    "in protocol: protocol"
    index: anInteger
    	index value: anInteger
    
    "in protocol: protocol-events"
    whenIndexChanged: aBlock
    	index whenChangedDo: aBlock



The last step to define a new model is to implement a method `adapterName` at class side\.The method should be in the protocol named *spec* and should return a symbol\.The symbol should be composed of the basic concept of the widget, e\.g\. list or button, and the word *Adapter* like **ListAdapter**\.

Since the same model can hold the state of different views, like in the MVC pattern, multiple adapters can refer to the same model\.Consequently, the adapter updating logic uses the dependents mechanism\.In fact the message `change: with: ` is used to call the message *selector* on the adaptor with the arguments *aCollection* to the adapter\.The propagation is done regardless of the number of adapters\.



    Note: For Ben: I do not understand the above paragraph. Is it there to explain the existence of the adapterName method? This is not clear at all.




###5\.3\.  The Adapter




    Note: For Ben: What is the class of the adaptor? Clarify.



The adapter name should be composed of the UI framework name, e\.g\. Morphic, and the name of the adapter it is implementing, e\.g\. ListAdapter\.The adapter is an object used to connect a UI framework specific element and the framework independent model\.The only mandatory method for an adapter is `defaultSpec` on the class side\.



    Note: For Ben: What should defaultSpec do? What are its responsibilities? Give an example.



Since the adapter is bridging the gap between the element of the UI framework and the model, the adapter also needs to forward the queries from the UI element to the model\.Seen from the other way around: since the model is holding the state, the adapter is used to update the UI element state of the model\.

The methods involved in the communication with the model should be in the protocol *spec protocol* while the methods involded in the UI element should be *widget API*\.



    Note: For Ben: Rephrase: in the communication FROM the model TO the UI element should be ... and in the communication FROM the UI element TO the model should be ... I am confused which is which.



To communicate with the UI element, the adapter methods uses the method `widgetDo:`\.This method executes the block provided as argument, which will only happen after the ui element has already been created\.



    Note: For Ben: An example is needed here.




###5\.4\.  The UI Framework binding


The bindings is an object that is used to resolve the name of the adapter at run time\.This allows for the same model to be used with several UI frameworks\.



    Note: For Ben: What is the class of the bindings (text above)? What is the default adapter (text below)?



Adding the new adapter to the default adapter is quite simple\.It requires to update two methods: `initializeBindings` in **SpecAdapterBindings** and `initializeBindings` in the framework specific adapter class, e\.g\. **MorphicAdapterBindings** for Morphic\.



    Note: For Ben: Give an example here.



Once this is done, the bindings should be re\-initialized by running the following snippet of code: `SpecInterpreter hardResetBindings`\.
