!! The heart of Spec

Spec is built around three axes borrowed from the MVP pattern.
Those axes are materialized as three methods: ==initializeWidgets==, ==initializePresenter==, and ==defaultSpec==.

!!! ==initializeWidgets== the Presenter


!!! ==initializePresenter== the Interactor	


!!! ==defaultSpec== the View
