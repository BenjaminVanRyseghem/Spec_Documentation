#Spec: a new framework for describing user intefaces 


##Introduction 


Writing user interfaces is notoriously a tedious tasks\. It often requires time and a clear understanding of the separation of concerns\. Indeed most of the frameworks mix domain applicative models with widget models\.

The following article will introduce you how to use  `Spec` through several examples\.  The general purpose of  `Spec` will be explained then will follow a presentation of every  `Spec` widgets and how to use them\. This paper will be concluded by  `n` examples about how to compose basic widgets in order to build complete user interfaces\. 

## The heart of Spec 
<a name="sec_heart_of_spec"></a>

Spec is built around three axes borrowed from the MVP pattern\. Those axes are materialized as three methods:  `initializeWidgets`,  `initializePresenter`, and  `defaultSpec`\. We first detail some necessary terminology before discussing each of these in detail\. 


To avoid possible misundertandings due to terminology issues because of overloaded meanings, we first define four terms: 
<dl><dt>UI Element
</dt><dd>an interactive graphical element displayed as part of the Graphical User Interface.</dd><dt>UI Model
</dt><dd>an object that contains the state and behavior of one or several UI elements.</dd><dt>Widget
</dt><dd>the union of a UI Element and its UI model.</dd><dt>Basic widgets
</dt><dd>low level widgets like a list, a button, etc. They are not composed of other widgets.</dd></dl>



###  *initializeWidgets* the widgets  <sub>the MVP View</sub>


This takes care of the configuration of the different widgets themselves, without the interaction\. It is used to instantiate the subwidgets and to specify their default values and general behavior\. This focus in this method is to specify how the widgets will look like\. 

In general  `initializeWidgets` should follow the pattern: 


-  widgets instantiation 
-  widgets specification 
-  set the order of focus 

&nbsp;

The code  [1\.1\. ](#pattern) is an example of an  `initializeWidgets` method\. 



<a name="pattern"></a>**Example of initializeWidgets**


    initializeWidgets
    
    	button := self newButton.
    
    	button label: 'I am a button'.
    	
    	self focusOrder
    		add: button



Note that this method is mandatory\. Each subclass need to override it\. 


#### Widget instantiation 


The instantiation of a widget can be done in two ways\. First if it is a basic widget \(like a button or a list\) which is instantiated, then the framework provides accesors for them\. The format of this accessors is  `new[Widget]`\. By example  `newList`,  `newText`, etc\. The complete list of available widget creation methods can be found in the class  *ComposableModel* in the protocol  *widgets*\. 

Second if one wants to reuse any subclass of  *ComposableModel* the widget needs to be initialized using the  `instantiate:` method\. The example  [1\.2\. ](#use_of_instantiate) shows how to instantiate a  *MessageBrowser*\. 



<a name="use_of_instantiate"></a>**How to reuse a MessageBrowser widget**


    widget := self instantiate: MessageBrowser.




###  *initializePresenter* the Presenter  <sub>the MVP Interactor</sub>


This takes care of the interactions between the different widgets\. This method specifies the flow of exectution linking the sub widgets all together\. All the interaction between one widget and another is specified here\. 

Usually this method is composed of actions to perform when a specific event is received\. Based on value holders,  **Spec** event mechanism rely on the value holder announcements\. Value holders provide a single method  `whenChangedDo:` to register a block to perform on change\. The propagation of those events build the whole interaction flow\. 

Moreover the basic widgets provide a full set of registration methods\. The whole API is described in the section  [Â¿?\. ](#sec_where_to_find_what_I_want)\. 




    If a programmer wants his or her widgets to be reused,
    they should provide a comprehensive API.



Note that this method is optional\. 


###  *defaultSpec* the View  <sub>the MVP Presenter</sub>


This takes care of the layout of the different widgets\. This class side method is used to specify the position of each sub widgets\. It also specifies how a widget reacts when the window is resized\. 

Multiple layouts can be described\. Then when the widget is built a specific layout can be specified\. 

This method is on class side because usually all the instances of a same user interface have the same layout\. But the lookup for the spec method to use starts on instace side\. This way a class can have a more specific layout depending of the instance state\. 


#### Pragmas 


As previously said, multiple views can be described for the same user interface\. In order to retrieve the correct method to apply, the spec methods are flagged with a pragma\. 

The pragma can be  `<spec: default>` for the view to use by default, or  `<spec>` for the other views\. 


#### Examples 


This section provides a list of examples about the constructions of layouts\. It starts with a  [basic ](#layout_basic_example) example\. Then two examples are given about the creation of  [rows and columns ](#layout_rows_and_column_layout)\. Now that rows and columns do not have any mystery, two other examples explain how to set a  [fix size ](#layout_set_size_pixels) for rows and columns\. Another example explains how to specify a widget  [proportions ](#layout_percentage)\. The last example presents the  [expert ](#layout_expert) mode in case everything else failed\. 


<a name="layout_basic_example"></a>
The simpliest example is to just render one widget\. The example  [1\.3\. ](#ex_layout1) presents such a layout\. 



<a name="ex_layout1"></a>**Layout with only one widget**


    ^ SpecLayout composed
    	add: #myWidget;
    	yourself



The symbol  `myWidget` refers to an instance side method returning a widget\. Note that by default, a widget will take all the space available\. 

---

<a name="layout_rows_and_column_layout"></a>
Often user interfaces can be describes in rows and columns\. The example  [1\.4\. ](#ex_layout_row) sows how to build a row of widgets\. 



<a name="ex_layout_row"></a>**Row of widgets**


    ^ SpecLayout composed
    	newRow: [ :row |
    		row
    			add: #myFirstWidget;
    			add: #mySecondWidget
    	];
    	yourself



Now having the widgets rendered as a column is very similar as show in the example  [1\.5\. ](#ex_layout_column)



<a name="ex_layout_column"></a>**Column of widgets**


    ^ SpecLayout composed
    	newColumn: [ :column |
    		column
    			add: #myFirstWidget;
    			add: #mySecondWidget
    	];
    	yourself




---
<a name="layout_set_size_pixels"></a>
The height of row, as well as the width of a column, can be specified to prevent it to take all the space available\. The example  [1\.6\. ](#ex_row_height) shows how to specify the height of a row in pixels while the example  [1\.7\. ](#ex_column_width) how to specify the column width\. 



<a name="ex_row_height"></a>**Row of 30px**


    ^ SpecLayout composed
    	newRow: [ :row |
    		row
    			add: #myFirstWidget;
    			add: #mySecondWidget
    	] height: 30;
    	yourself





<a name="ex_column_width"></a>**Column of 30px**


    ^ SpecLayout composed
    	newColumn: [ :column |
    		column
    			add: #myFirstWidget;
    			add: #mySecondWidget
    	] width: 30;
    	yourself



Note that it is a bad habit to hardcode the size of the widgets\. Methods are available on  *ComposableModel* providing some default size like the width of a button\. If one wants to use his or her own widget size, he or she should not forget to take in account the current font size\. 


---

<a name="layout_percentage"></a>
It is also possible to specify the percentage of the container a widget should occupy\. This way the widget size will change accordingly when the window is resized by example\. To do so, the four sides of a widget can be specified as shown in the example  [1\.8\. ](#ex_layout_proportional)\. 



<a name="ex_layout_proportional"></a>**Square centered and half the size of its container**


    ^ SpecLayout composed
    	add: #square top: 0.25 bottom: 0.25 left: 0.25 right: 0.25;
    	yourself



Note that the value provided as argument moves the corresponding side toward the center of the widget\. Note also that the argument can be an integer if the offset has to be a fixed number of pixels\. 


---

<a name="layout_expert"></a>
The previous examples should cover most of the cases\. In case it does not, there is a last way to specify a widget position\. 

The method  `add: aWidget origin: originPoint corner: cornerPoint offsetOrigin: ooPoint offsetCorner: ocPoint` allows one to add a widget from origin point to cornerPoint\. Those two points represents respectively the top left corner and the bottom right corner of the widget\. The points represent a percentage of the container \(so the coordinates  <u>must</u> be between  *0* and  *1* \)\. 

In addition to those points, two offsets can be specified\. They represent the number of pixels the origin, respectively the corner, should be moved\. This approach is similar to the ProportionalLayout of  **Morphic**\. 

The exemple  [1\.9\. ](#ex_layout_expert) show how to add a widget as a toolbar\. The widget should take all the window width, but should be only 30px height\. 



<a name="ex_layout_expert"></a>**Expert Mode: toolbar**


    ^ SpecLayout composed
    	add: #toolbar origin: 0@0 corner: 1@0 offsetOrigin: 0@0 offsetCorner: 0@30;
    	yourself
